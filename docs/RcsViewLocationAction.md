# RcsViewLocationAction

Action to view a location on a map.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**latLong** | [**RcsLatLng**](RcsLatLng.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**label** | **String** | The label of the pin dropped at latLong. |  [optional] |
|**query** | **String** | (Optional, only supported on Android Messages clients) Instead of specifying a latLong (and optionally, a label), the agent can specify a query string. For default map apps that support search functionality (including Google Maps), tapping this suggested action results in a location search centered around the user&#39;s current location.              For instance, setting the query string to \&quot;Growing Tree Bank\&quot; will show all Growing Tree Bank locations in the user&#39;s vicinity. Setting the query string to \&quot;1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043\&quot; will select that specific address, regardless of the user&#39;s location.        |  [optional] |
